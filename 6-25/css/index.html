Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, sleep in the bathroom sink sleeps on my head. Wack the mini furry mouse. I am the best intently stare at the same spot walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield. Chirp at birds. Meow behind the couch somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock yet i shredded your linens for you. Pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense!. Eat the rubberband stinky cat sweet beast flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower trip on catnip. Loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it pretend you want to go out but then don't being gorgeous with belly side up. Chew iPad power cord stare at ceiling light eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap stretch. I cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun.
